[WIP] Docker, OpenResty and eXist (dorex)
<!-- Value Proposition -->
Created to help me build secure websites

<!--Short Description -->
Made to Fork or Clone, this my current working development environment 
to help me work with OpenResty and eXistdb. 
Both OpenResty and eXistdb run in containers.

OpenResty is set up as a reverse proxy and gateway for the eXist database.
